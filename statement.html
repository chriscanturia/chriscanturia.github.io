  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am a video artist focusing on a wide range of themes such as website interactivity and the struggle between technology and social interactions. As an artist, I look for deeper meanings in videos and incorporate some of those themes into my own videos and websites.  My interests with technology began when I encountered a video about how technology is affecting human interactions. It fascinated me enough to start making video art about human interactions with technology.  I also create websites based on what I think will be the future of adventure logging.

  <p>My videos are a reflection of past experiences. In Lost, 2018, I found myself thinking about how technology is sort of controlling what I do everyday. Lost is a video about how we are surrounded by technology. Everywhere we go, there is some sort of device that will distract us and lose focus. Not all technology is bad, but we live in a world full of technology, that it feels like we are the ones revolving around technology and not the other way around. Calm and Chaos, 2018 is my take on the calmness of nature but also the destruction it can create. It is a powerful piece because it educates people about never underestimating nature because it can be very destructive and unpredictable. Mapper, 2018 is a continuation and final version of Worldmap, 2018. The concept of Mapper is that it is an adventure logging website in which you can add interesting places youâ€™ve visited in that particular area.
