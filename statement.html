  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am a video and net artist who explores themes such as gentrification, drug use,  and the struggle between technology and social interactions. Video art lets me explore these themes more closely and firsthand. My video art can be described as realistic and disorienting at times since most of my video art is in my point of view. I do this because I want the audience to follow this adventure with me whatever that adventure may be. The art I produced during the second semester of my Junior year at SJSU was primarily focused on drug use and the feelings associated after taking a substance. People often talk about drugs without even encountering that drug firsthand or even experiencing what the drug does to you. I researched and found multiple websites talking about what drugs feel like when you’re addicted. Based on this, I created a net art/video art website about the different stages of being high called Curiously Misguided Skater. I want to open the discussion of drug use and abuse, and how we can help those who are addicted. I am also a portrait and street photographer exploring themes of gentrification, isolation, and the world of the Unknown. I am currently working on a series of 20 portraits called the “Unknown” series in which I utilize movement in the portraits to create abstract forms. These forms represent things we cannot see such as emotion. I’m also working on a project called the “Vacancy” series. This series documents the people affected by the rise of rent prices in the Bay Area.
