  <h1>Hill Lake</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;" > The City is blessed with natural wonders and Hill Lake
    is one of them. It is located east of the Pink Forrest. The lake itself is pink
    because of the certain type of algae that lives in the lake. The algae itself eats
    bacteria harmful to humans. The Algae is collected once every year and is released
    in different lakes around the world.  </p>
