    <h3>"Calm and Chaos", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
    <p>In this piece, I wanted to show the calmness in nature, but also show how destructive it can be. Also this work is meant to inform people on how unpredictable nature is and how we must be ready in case of a natural disaster. The work is split into two videos in one screen. The left side shows videos of water and the other, videos of fire. The videos start off  with calm elements to both water and fire. As the videos progress, they get more and more chaotic until the end where it gets calm again. I picture this piece to be installed in a square closed room because I want the viewer to be surrounded with sound to "feel" the power of water and fire. Audio is a big part in this piece. All the audio associated with water is on the left side while all the audio associated with fire is on the right. It is also encouraged for people to walk around and hear the different sounds. </p>
